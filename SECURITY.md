| **Note that** most times the patches are related to fix UI disagreements, not vulnerability
problems. Commonly these type of issues relate only to the project structure, and not to the
packages that we publish.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerability while using Canada in your project or in someone else's project,
please open an issue with the label **Vulnerability**, then our team will be aware and take a
look at it to help you.
